# [Project 2: Predicting House Prices with Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data)

## Goal

The goal of this project is to use EDA, visualization, data cleaning, preprocesing, and linear models to predict home prices given the features of the home, and interpret the linear models to find out what features add value to a home.

From the Kaggle competition website:

    Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.

    With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.
